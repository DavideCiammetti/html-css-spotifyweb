## About this respository
This project is a copy of the spotify web app, using only HTML and CSS. Thanks to the use of media query it was possible to create it responsive in 3 screen modes:
1. mobile
2. tablet
3. desktop

starting from the 'mobile first' mode. The overall structure of the layout reflects the ![Alt text](img/spotify-lg.png) reference image.
